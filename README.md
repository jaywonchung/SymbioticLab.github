# SymbioticLab

We build efficient systems for big data and AI/ML applications that best leverage their underlying infrastructure -- A symbiosis of application and infrastructure.


## Our Latest Directions ðŸ”¥

### Energy-Efficiency

Energy is a new first-class systems resource. [Zeus](https://github.com/ml-energy/zeus), as part of the [ML.ENERGY](https://ml.energy) initiative, takes the first step as an open-source framework for deep learning energy measurement and optimization.

### Fault Tolerance

The larger the system, the more prone it is to failures. [Oobleck](https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Oobleck) is a large model training system that is fast in the common case and resilient even when nodes fail.

### Memory Disaggregation

### Federated Learning

We want to learn useful models even without moving user data out of devices like phones. [FedScale](https://fedscale.ai) is an extensible engine and benchmarking framework for federated learning.
